# quackR: Emotional Support and Rubber Duck Debugging
Needed to publish an R package for a uni course, decided to make it a fun exercise and created a rubber duck debugger buddy in R


## Description
The 'quackR' package provides a suite of interactive tools to help developers through the psychological hurdles of debugging. By utilizing the 'Wise Duck' and the principles of Rubber Duck Debugging, users can verbalize their logic, find bugs and regain their will to code.

## Key Functions

### quack_debug

#### Description
Use the power of rubber duck debugging to find bugs faster. Simply talk the duck through your code by explaining the logic line by line and be surprised by the EURICA moment once you find the bug by talking to a virtual duck.

During the conversation you can type "done" to exit.

If the bug is persistent and your patience is running low, take a break and enjoy some emotional support by running quack_a_geddon

#### Usage
quack_debug()

### quack_a_geddon

#### Description
Escape the debugging induced emotional Quack-A-Geddon and let the wise duck of the magic pond fill you with the motivation to continue your quest for bug free code.

Once your inner pond has settled and your drive returns you should check out quack_debug to gain a companion on your quest towards bug free code.
